<h3> Passive voice is when you use a tense of "to be" followed by another verb.  For example, "Gatsby is portrayed as flawed" is passive, while "Fitzgerald potrays Gatsby as flawed" is clear and to the point. While passive voice is sometimes okay, it usually deters from the conciseness of your writing. </h3>

<p> You have used passive voice <%= @passivetimes %> times, using <strong> is </strong> <%= @istimes %> times, <strong> was </strong> <%= @wastimes %> times, and <strong> were </strong> <%= @weretimes %> times.  See if you can make these sentences more direct. </p>
